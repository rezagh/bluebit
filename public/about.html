Blue Bit operates with a lean, flexible model. I personally lead every project, working with hand-picked developers and specialists based on your specific needs.
This approach ensures you always have acess to the main decision maker throughout your project,
get exactly the expertise your project needs, without paying for overhead of a large permanent team.

All our team is remote and mainly based in Australia. I have also developers across Asia to rapidly scale up if needed.
